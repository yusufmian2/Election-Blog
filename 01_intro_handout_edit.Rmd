# (Re-)Introductions!

## * Icebreaker: name, hometown, favorite piece of media consumed this summer and why

# Today's agenda

![](imgs copy/the_numbers.jpg){width=750px, height=550px}

1.  **Set-up:** Kick off your career as a *professional*
    election analyst: 

    -   Set up your own blog on GitHub
    -   Review some key data analysis tools 
    -   Review what makes a good data visualization

2.  **Describing trends in the popular vote:** Build your
    *first visualizations* to answer two foundational
    questions:

    -   How competitive are midterm elections in the United States?
    -   Which states and districts vote blue/red and how consistently?
\newpage    

# 1. Set-Up

## Setting up your election analysis blog

1.  Make a *GitHub* account (if you don't have one) 

2.  Go to https://pages.github.com

3.  Select the options below and follow the instructions:

# Our (actual) workflow for this class

1. Set your working directory in R to your Github repository for this class.

2. Download the weekly section data from the Google drive (~/Lab sessions/01-Intro (9/8)/Section data
https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1fOPjqzf6d4rVjewC0qP6HTgZKoQEsV47) to your Gov 1347 Github repository.

3. Describe, visualize, and otherwise work with the section data in Rmarkdown. 

# Our workflow for today

1. Create folder in your file management system for this class and set this as your working directory.

2. Download the weekly section data from the Google drive (~/Lab sessions/01-Intro (9/8)/Section data
https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1fOPjqzf6d4rVjewC0qP6HTgZKoQEsV47) to your Gov 1347 folder.

3. Describe, visualize, and otherwise work with the section data in Rmarkdown. 


# The `R` analyst's workflow

-   Descriptive inference (vs) Causal inference (vs) Predictive
    inference

# The `R` election analyst's workflow

![](imgs copy/data_science_2.png){width=500px}

Caveat: **descriptive** models aren't always useful for
**predictive** inference and vice versa. We will try to be
*principled* in how we approach both tasks ... and be
careful not to automatically conflate either with **causal**
inference.

## 2. Describing Trends in the Popular Vote

## Load data (\texttt{read\_csv})

We're going to analyze major-party midterm candidates' popular votes
from 1948-2020:

First, download the data from the section folder and move it your folder for this class.

```{r, include=TRUE, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# set working directory first always
 setwd("~/Desktop/Election Analysis")
library(tidyverse)
popvote_df <- read_csv("house nationwide vote and seat share by party 1948-2020.csv")
```


```{r, include=TRUE, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

colnames(popvote_df)

```


```{r, eval=TRUE, include=TRUE, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

head(popvote_df[c("year", "winner_party", "winning_vote_margin")])

```

## Subsetting data (\texttt{filter}, \texttt{select})

It's always a good idea to spot-check your dataset: \texttt{filter} on
specific rows and \texttt{select} specific columns.

```{r, include=TRUE, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
popvote_df %>% 
  filter(year == 2018) %>% 
  select(D_seats, D_majorvote_pct, winner_party)


```

## Formatting data to wide or long (\texttt{spread}, \texttt{gather}) 

Depending on what you want the unit of analysis to be, you might want to
change how the data look. 

Currently, long format (the unit of analysis: party-race)

```{r, include=TRUE, echo=TRUE}
popvote_df %>%
    select(year, winner_party, winning_vote_margin) %>%
    filter(year %in% c(1948, 1952, 1956))

```

## Formatting data to wide or long (\texttt{spread}, \texttt{gather}) 

Long to wide format (unit of analysis: race) 

```{r, include=TRUE, echo=TRUE}
popvote_wide_df <- popvote_df %>%
  select(year, winner_party, winning_vote_margin) %>%
  spread(key = winner_party, value = winning_vote_margin) #spread function sets a variable so we get the value of winning margin assigned to D and R answers to winner _party

head(popvote_wide_df, 3)

```

## Formatting data to wide or long (\texttt{spread}, \texttt{gather}) 

Wide to long format (unit of analysis: candidate-race)

```{r, include=TRUE, echo=TRUE}
popvote_wide_df %>%
  gather(key = "winner_party", value = "winning_vote_margin",
         D, R) %>% 
  filter(year %in% c(1948, 1952, 1956))
```

## Modifying our data (many options)

With our wide race-level dataframe, we can code who wins each race:

-   With base \texttt{R}:

```{r, include=TRUE, echo=TRUE}

#popvote_wide_df$winner <- ifelse(
 # is.na(popvote_wide_df$D == TRUE), 
  #"Republican", "Democrat")

```

-   With \texttt{tidyverse}:

```{r, include=TRUE, echo=TRUE}
popvote_wide_df <- popvote_wide_df %>%
  mutate(winner = case_when(D != "NA" ~ "Democrat",
                            TRUE ~ "Republican"))
```

## Summaries of our data (\texttt{summarise})

Now we can ask: from 1948 - 2016, how many races were won by Democrats?

```{r, eval=TRUE, include=TRUE, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
popvote_wide_df %>% 
  group_by(winner) %>%
  summarise(races = n())
```

## Merging datasets together (\texttt{*\_join}) 

Most interesting datasets are actually merges of individual datasets. A
hypothetical example is merging in yearly GDP with our race-level data:

```{r, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
popvote_and_economy_df <- popvote_wide_df %>%
  left_join(economy_df, by = "year")
```


There are different types of joins depending on how you want to deal
with un-merged rows. Ex: 

-   \texttt{left\_join} discards un-merged rows originally in
    \texttt{economy\_df} 
-   \texttt{inner\_join} discards un-merged rows in both dataframes
 
-   \texttt{full\_join} keeps all the rows in both dataframes 

\newpage
## Visualising our data in \texttt{ggplot2} 

**Review**: After passing data into \texttt{ggplot} command and selecting
the type of \texttt{geom\_}\* plot, you must gradually \`\`layer'' on
the plot attributes:

```{r, include=TRUE, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(data = df, mapping = aes(x = x_col, y = y_col)) +
  geom_bar()
```

```{r, include=TRUE, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(data = df, mapping = aes(x = x_col, y = y_col)) +
  geom_bar() +
  xlab("x axis label") + 
  ylab("y axis label") + 
  ggtitle("my plot")
```

```{r, include=TRUE, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(data = df, mapping = aes(x = x_col, y = y_col)) +
  geom_bar() +
  xlab("x axis label") + 
  ylab("y axis label") + 
  ggtitle("my plot") +
  theme_classic() + 
  theme(axis.text = element_text(size = 10))
```

## Example: [FiveThirtyEight-esque](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/swing-states-2020-election/) replication in `ggplot2`

```{r, include=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, echo=FALSE, eval=TRUE, fig.align="center"}
#### want a state-level analysis
library(readr)
house_party_vote_share_by_district_1948_2020 <- read_csv("house party vote share by district 1948-2020.csv")

# ready to replicate facet plot
h %>% 
  filter(State %in% c("Arizona")) %>%
  filter(raceYear >= 2000) %>%
  group_by(district_id) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=raceYear, y=R_vote_margin*100, color=R_vote_margin)) + # *100

  theme_minimal() + 
    theme(
        panel.border = element_blank(),
        plot.title = element_text(size = 10, hjust = 0.5, face="bold"), 
        legend.position = "none",
        axis.title = element_text(size=10),
        axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1),
        axis.text = element_text(size = 10),
        strip.text = element_text(size = 10, face = "bold"))
```

# Final thoughts

-   Impossible to memorize every single `dplyr` and `ggplot2` command
    you'll need. 
-   Recommendation: create R Studio snippets for various plots we've
    shown today (`Preferences > Code > Snippets`).
-   Visualization is about communication, not coding ... points
    for **clarity** and **engagement**, not technical
    wizardry.
-   Lots of `ggplot2` tools to creatively communicate:
    \url{exts.ggplot2.tidyverse.org/gallery/}

# Blog extensions

1.  **Visualization customization.** Use the tools from this
    section to 
    1. create a map of Republican/Democrat voteshare margin
    by state in a year of your choice,
    2. create a map of Republican/Democrat voteshare margin by state
         and congressional district in 2014,
    3. label each state (e.g. `AZ`) in your map and
    4. create a custom `ggplot2` theme for your blog.
    
2.  **Gerrymandering extension.** So far, we've been looking at the
    voteshare margin by party. This means we have been working with the
    popular vote as opposed to the number of seats won in the House
    (recall our discussion from Tuesday about the inefficient geographic
    distribution of Democrats as compared to Republicans that results
    from gerrymandering --- the drawing of district boundaries to give
    parties electoral advantages. Read more here:
    \url{https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2015/03/01/this-is-the-best-explanation-of-gerrymandering-you-will-ever-see/},
    Why Cities Lose: The Deep Roots of the Urban-Rural Political Divide.
    Jonathan A. Rodden. Basic Books. 2019.).
    * Create a map of seat share by party for the entire U.S. in a year of
    your choice. 
      + You can find and download the data at this website:
      \url{https://guides.library.harvard.edu/hks/campaigns_elections>}. 
      + Select "CQ Voting & Elections Collection" \> Election Results \> Office:
      + House Elections \> Election Type: General \> Region: National \>
      + Year: [your choice]. 
      + Similar to the map you created of voteshare
      margin by state, your map should contain all 50 states shaded
      according the proportion of seats won by Republicans/Democrats. How do
      seat share and voteshare compare?
    
3.  \textbf{Swing state map extension.} Instead of plotting
    \textit{voteshare-margin} maps for each year $y$ where the color for
    a state is colored by the quantity $\frac{R_y}{D_y+R_y}$ (or
    $\frac{D_y}{D_y+R_y}$), plot a \textit{swing map} for each year
    where each state is colored by the quantity
    $\frac{R_y}{D_y+R_y} - \frac{R_{y-4}}{D_{y-4} + R_{y-4}}$. Which
    states are/have been battleground states? Which are no longer?
