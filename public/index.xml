      <description>Shocks and Pooled Models? In today’s blog I will briefly go over the idea of shocks as well as the final changes to my model including the potential for using a pooled model. Shocks are sudden events that may come up unexpected in an election season.

      <description>The Ground Game This week, we will delving into the ground game. To do this, I will be looking at turnout mostly along with some other aspects as well as talking about my model. The first thing I wanted to explore with turnout was to consider the common “myth” in political science that higher turnout benefits Democrats. To do this, I took a look at the Citizen Voting Age Population (CVAP) data available by district from 2012 to 2020 and compared it to the actual turnout.</description>

      <description>Week 5 - The Air War For this week’s blog, I will be delving into the concept of ad buys and how this may impact congressional races. To do this, we will be trying to build a model where we look at what impact the number of ad buys has on the eventual turnout of the race. As you will see below, we are looking at ads from the years 2006 to 2018.</description>

      <description>Week 4 - Incumbency and Expert Predictions For this week’s blog, I am going to be looking into the reliability of expert predictions. Expert predictions have become more prevalent over time, but today we are going to be looking at expert predictions from the most recent midterm elections. To do so, we will be taking a deep dive into expert predictions in the 2018 midterm elections through visualization. Because expert predictions are at the district level, I took a look at expert predictions at the district level in the mapping.</description>

However, before I get into the choices I have made in my own predictions for the election, I am going to be taking a deeper dive into some of the decisions that went into two of the most well known models that exist for election predictions.</description>
