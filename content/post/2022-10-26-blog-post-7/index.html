<h2>Shocks and Pooled Models?</h2>
<p><br>
Before I get into the model for this week, I will be talking about the potential of a pooled model and why I will not be using it for this week. While I think turnout by demographics is obviously very variable, from what I have looked into, I think even the effects that the largest of demographic changes may have on the final result of a prediction are overstated. For example, I looked at doubling various demographic groups and saw smaller than expected changes on the final predictions. Part of this is because within one district, the impact of a demographic may be hard to understand. While we may understand the national or state impact of a demographic group, within one district that group may happen to be represented differently and may not be the same as a demographic group in a different district. People are diverse and models are hard and even harder for such small samples of by district. Additionally, because the 2022 election is the first election with the 2020 census congressional maps, I think it also would not be good to incorporate a model that uses demographic data or predictions from potentially different districts.</p>

<h2>Updates to model</h2>
<p>This week, there are no new signifcant updates to the model. However, I have gone and used the district model which I showed in detail last week and used it for all of the districts that should be close and of interest. In the table below, you can see the list of predicted winners and Democratic 2-Party voteshare for these close districts. The weights and formula is the same as the MI-10 I showed last week where Cook PVI of a district is 0.3, the expert prediction model is 0.3, the polling is 0.2, and the economic model is 0.2 However, even though our model is already not great for district polling, it is made even worse in that some districts either had no polling (or the only polling seemed very bad to me because it wasn’t even polling the actual nominee or was very old). In these cases, I had to drop polling and chose to add this weight to the expert predictions, which I have found to be the best of our models, so expert predictions becomes 0.5 in that case. One other thing of interest is that I have noticed in some districts which have a PVI indicating a not so close race, Democratic incumbents might be hurt by this in my model. In other words, some Democratic incumbents may be able to win in Trump or Republican districts, but my model doesn’t really account for that when considering PVI. Therefore, I am acknowleding this as one possible drawback which I haven’t been able to avoid. I still think on the whole PVI is important to consider the landscape of a district and account for voters who vote the same year to year.
