<h2>Updates to model</h2>
<p>This week, there are no new signifcant updates to the model. However, I have gone and used the district model which I showed in detail last week and used it for all of the districts that should be close and of interest. In the table below, you can see the list of predicted winners and Democratic 2-Party voteshare for these close districts. The weights and formula is the same as the MI-10 I showed last week where Cook PVI of a district is 0.3, the expert prediction model is 0.3, the polling is 0.2, and the economic model is 0.2 However, even though our model is already not great for district polling, it is made even worse in that some districts either had no polling (or the only polling seemed very bad to me because it wasn’t even polling the actual nominee or was very old). In these cases, I had to drop polling and chose to add this weight to the expert predictions, which I have found to be the best of our models, so expert predictions becomes 0.5 in that case. One other thing of interest is that I have noticed in some districts which have a PVI indicating a not so close race, Democratic incumbents might be hurt by this in my model. In other words, some Democratic incumbents may be able to win in Trump or Republican districts, but my model doesn’t really account for that when considering PVI. Therefore, I am acknowleding this as one possible drawback which I haven’t been able to avoid. I still think on the whole PVI is important to consider the landscape of a district and account for voters who vote the same year to year.
